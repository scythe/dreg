# dreg - regular expression derivative-based pattern matcher

dreg is currently in the very early stage of development. The aim is simply to make
the smallest efficient regex matcher possible. Code is approximately documented in header files.

# whatever happened to this repo?

Development of `dreg` was suspended when I lost the paper it was based on. That was many moons ago, but I
should probably finish it anyway, seeing as there isn't much left to do.
